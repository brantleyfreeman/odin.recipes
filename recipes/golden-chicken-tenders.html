        <h2>This is my favorite chicken recipe. It is quick, easy and delicious. I serve the chicken tenders with cranberry sauce, rice and spinach.</h2>

        <p>If you don't know, chicken tenders are the narrow, strip of meat loosely attached to the underside of chicken breasts. They taste exactly the same as breast meat, but are juicy and tender when cooked properly. Tenders can be pulled gently from a breast, or find them sold separately at your supermarket/butcher.</p>
